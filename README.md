Welcome to my test application for the use of the Mann-Kendall test on real-time 
stock trades from the New York and NASDAQ exchanges.

I don't think showing you a math equation; but not showing how it can be effectively
used, is very useful. This tutorial takes the opposite view. 
We will not show the mathematics of the Mann-Kendall test. 
Instead, we will show how the Mann-Kendall test can be effectively 
used in detecting Buy/Sell signals in a price pattern I call the Bottle Rocket Pattern.

Here is a video of my test application that shows the effectiveness of the Mann-Kendall
algorithm that is used to signal when real-time stock data start an increaasing or
decreasing price pattern.

If you like this code and video, please buy me a cup of coffee. It will encourage me
to create more like this.
